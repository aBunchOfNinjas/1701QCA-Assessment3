This project is related to mine because its lighting system is very similar to the intended lighting set up that I will use. This project uses eight WS2812/Neopixel LED light strips that are stacked vertically and programmed to display text, my implementation of this sign will use the microbits 5 high LED resolution and will be about a meter long compared to this project which is about 7 meters long.

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
<!--- Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence. --->

### Design ideation ###
<!--- Document your ideation process. This will include the design concepts presented for assessment 2. You can copy and paste that information here. --->
### Refine and review ###

### Design concept 1 ###
My first idea for an interactive that aligns with the design intent, was inspired by Seiko Mikami's *Desire of Codes* this interactive installation has a range of cameras that follow visitors recording them, this footage is projected onto a screen showing past and present visitors in a cool hexagonal visualization. My idea was to use the microbit to create a smart home device reminiscent of Google home/Alexa, the device would listen to people around it and then play back recording of what people have said around it. The device could even have some visual element to get people talking about it while they're nearby. 

One of the big dampeners on this idea is the limitations of the microbit. Its only a simple device with limited processing power and storage and has pretty limited functionality when it comes to audio. Due to the small storage size the melodies that it can play are short, only a few seconds and as fair as I am concerned there is no way to record sounds.
This combined with the intensive processing that would be required to trim audio clips and play them back puts the microbit in out of its depths. 

[Seiko Mikami's Desire of Codes](https://www.ntticc.or.jp/en/exhibitions/2011/mikami-seiko-desire-of-codes/)

### Design concept 2 ###
My second idea was focused around the infinite scroll user interface used by many of the most popular apps today. The human nature of how we are so easily captivated by this UI I find very interesting. From my own personal experience I've found my self captivated by a screen on many an odd occasion yet it is hard to resist; On the bus looking at the persons phone I front of me if I don't have my own, during a conversation even when I'm quite engaged in it, and when some ones instagram feed is in my field of view, all of these examples are just when I'm looking at others screens and not my own. So is it the swiping or the screen? This is an idea that I wanted to explore for the design intent. My idea to implement this would be screen similar to a phone with a similar UI to instagram of facebook however instead of showing a personalized catalog of images they would be random or stock images. The purpose would be to see how and if people would engage with just a random feed. Would people scroll? How long for? Other interesting ideas for this project could be placing it at a free charging station to see if people would use it to substitute their phone.

### Initial final design concept  ###
The final design concept is a sculpture that displays text on an LED screen and that text changes as a person approaches and it detected by the sculpture. The LED screen will be the focal point of the sculpture as it will display a range of text strings with different messages; one standard loop and one for when someone is detected to be in front of the sculpture.  The sculpture will be used to provoke interest and attract people to engage in the interaction. 

#### Functionality ####
The technical functionality will vary in complexity the electronic implementation should be quite simple with only a range of LED strips and a sensor to be connected to the micro bit however, the coding side of the project will be quite intensive. 
The following is a wiring diagram

#### Fabrication ####
At the current stage of the project much of the fabrication is still to be worked out. My current thinking is to get a long sheet of flexible plastic and bend it into the figure 8 style shape the led screen can then be glued onto this. In the image further down of the paper prototype hanging up the sculpture is supported by string this will likely be use to hang the final project as well. The electronic componated will 
##### Material list #####
* 5m RGB addressable LED strip WS2812 60LEDs/meter 
* Electrical wire?
* Heat shrink tubing?
* Strip of flexible plastic?
* String
* Wood or other construction material(for hanging frame)

#### Aesthetics ####
The aesthetics of Jenny Holzers LEDS have been very inspirational in the conception of the project. With the first conception seeming quite reminiscent of some of her works. 
 ![Image](ledlights.JPG)
 The image above is a sketch of the original conception. The black text is the original imagining of how the project may look. The red text is the revision of the design having a smaller LED screen in the center of the sculpture.  This decision was made to shorten the LED screen after researching the materials to use. It was quickly discovered after a few measurements of a paper prototype that a lot of LEDs will be needed and that it would be quite expensive to have lights running around the whole sculpture. 
It was calculated that the prototype was 336cm long and I intend on using a 5 high LED resolution like the micro bit so this would need 15 meters of LED strips. After looking on the Neopixel website it was found that even buying the cheapest strips (30LEDS/meter) would cost a whole $300+ and this is not feasible, so cutting the LED screen down to 1 meter means this project can be more affordable with almost the same aesthetic effect.
 ![Image](papermockuponground.JPG)
The paper prototype is shown above this was made very simply and was used to estimate the LED cost as well as getting a feel for how the whole thing will look, feel and work.

#### Interaction ####
At the stage of development when I considered interaction I was racking my head to think about how people could engage with this project as it was only text scrolling across the screen. I thought about the different triggers and interfaces that are available, starting with the ones that on board the microbit. However, I did not think of a suitable trigger in the inventors kit I did think of using an ultrasonic distance sensor as it could detect people approaching the artwork to view it. At this point I had the epiphany to combine a LED strip of text with the figure 8 style shape and make it a sculpture. In incorporating the LED screen into the sculpture I believe people will be drawn into the artwork and will approach it for a closer look. This then can trigger the interaction of the text changing state. Testing, iterating and experimenting will be required to find out if the interaction will actually be carried out. Designing a range of signifiers to signal appropriate action may be required.

### Interaction flowchart ###
<!--- Include an interaction flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible. --->

## Process documentation ##
<!--- In this section, include text and images (and potentially links to video) that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.

This should have quite a lot of information! It will likely include most of the process documentation from assessment 2 which can be copied and pasted here.

Use subheadings to structure this information. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for details of how to insert subheadings.

There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. --->
